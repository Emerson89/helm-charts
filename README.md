## Usage
Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helmâ€™s documentation to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```
helm repo add tpl https://emerson89.github.io/helm-charts
```
You can then run `helm search repo tpl` to see the charts.

Chart documentation is available in [directory](https://github.com/Emerson89/helm-charts).
